# Analysis-of-heating-and-cooling-load
Introduction
The goal of the project is to
Analyze heating and cooling load using energy parameters of different shapes, leveraging regression models and comparing scores and effectiveness futher
implementing advanced data mining algorithms to facilitate the identification of overall load to make informed decision to choose shape of a component
and visualizing data using Pandaâ€™s libraries in Python
